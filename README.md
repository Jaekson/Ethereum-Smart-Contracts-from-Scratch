## Ethereum & Smart Contracts from Scratch
This repository accompanies the Udemy course - "Ethereum Tutorial: Ethereum & Smart Contracts from Scratch" by David Katz.

#### Take the course here: [https://www.udemy.com/build-ethereum-from-scratch?couponCode=GITHUB](https://www.udemy.com/build-ethereum-from-scratch?couponCode=GITHUB)
In the course, you will build your own version of Ethereum. Ethereum can be described in two words - "Decentralized Computer".

#### Decentralized Computer
A decentralized computer is like a normal computer. A normal computer executes a program using one machine.

But a decentralized computer executes a program using multiple machines. Every machine needs to agree upon the output of the program for its results to become official.

To build a decentralized computer, here are the essential elements:
1. A smart contract language.
2. A blockchain.
3. A network.
4. Transactions and accounts.
5. A state management data structure.

Definitely take the course if you're interested in exploring the concepts behind this project more deeply. The course is a line-by-line tutorial of this entire repository. And by the end of the course, you'll have your own version of Ethereum.
